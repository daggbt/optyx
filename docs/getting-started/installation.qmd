## For Users

Install Optyx from PyPI:
```bash
pip install optyx
```

Or using [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) (recommended for faster installs):
```bash
uv pip install optyx
```

## Requirements

- **Python 3.12+**
- **NumPy** ≥ 2.0
- **SciPy** ≥ 1.6.0 (for HiGHS LP solver)

All dependencies are installed automatically.

::: {.callout-note}
## SciPy Version for LP Fast Path
Optyx uses the HiGHS solver (via `scipy.optimize.linprog`) for linear programs, which requires **SciPy ≥ 1.6.0**. If you have an older version, Optyx will fall back to the simplex method with a warning.

For best performance, we recommend **SciPy ≥ 1.11** which includes the latest HiGHS improvements.

## Development Setup

For contributing or development:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/daggbt/optyx.git
cd optyx

# Install with uv (recommended)
uv sync

# Or with pip in editable mode
pip install -e .
```

## Verify Installation

Test that Optyx is installed correctly:

```{python}
from optyx import Variable, Problem

x = Variable("x", lb=0)
solution = Problem().minimize(x**2).subject_to(x >= 1).solve()
print(f"Optyx is working! x* = {solution['x']:.4f}")
```
