# Benchmarks

Optyx includes a comprehensive benchmark suite measuring **end-to-end performance** including variable creation, problem setup, constraint construction, and solving. All benchmarks compare against raw SciPy (which has no build phase).

## Quick Start

```bash
# Run all benchmark tests
uv run pytest benchmarks/ -v

# Generate performance analysis plots
uv run python benchmarks/run_benchmarks.py

# Copy plots to docs (for documentation updates)
cp benchmarks/results/*.png docs/assets/benchmarks/
```

::: {.callout-note}
## What We Measure
All benchmarks measure **total time** including:

- Variable creation
- Problem setup  
- Constraint construction
- Cold solve (first solve, includes compilation)
- Warm solve (cached subsequent solves)
:::

## Performance Summary

| Problem Type | Size | Cold Overhead | Warm Overhead | Notes |
|--------------|------|---------------|---------------|-------|
| **LP** | n=50 | 1.8x | 1.4x | Near-parity with SciPy linprog |
| **LP** | n=500 | 2.8x | 1.0x | Warm solves at parity |
| **LP** | n=2000 | 1.9x | 0.9x | Scales to large problems |
| **NLP** | n=50 | 8.0x | 1.3x | Autodiff compilation cost |
| **NLP** | n=500 | 12.5x | **0.4x** | Warm solves 2.5x faster than SciPy |
| **CQP** | n=50 | 3.0x | 0.9x | O(1) Jacobian compilation |
| **CQP** | n=500 | 1.4x | **0.8x** | Warm solves faster than SciPy |

**Key Insight**: Cold solves include one-time compilation. Warm solves (repeated optimization with cached structure) achieve near-parity or better than raw SciPy.

## LP Scaling: VectorVariable vs Loop-Based

![LP Scaling Comparison](assets/benchmarks/lp_scaling_comparison.png){width=100%}

### Loop-Based Variables (n ≤ 100)

| n | Build | Cold Solve | Warm Solve | SciPy | Cold Overhead | Warm Overhead |
|---|-------|------------|------------|-------|---------------|---------------|
| 10 | 0.2ms | 7.0ms | 1.5ms | 1.1ms | 6.6x | 1.6x |
| 25 | 0.6ms | 31.3ms | 1.3ms | 1.2ms | 26.0x | 1.6x |
| 50 | 2.7ms | 239.4ms | 1.8ms | 1.7ms | 141.1x | 2.6x |
| 100 | 10.9ms | 2,291ms | 3.2ms | 3.0ms | 757x | 4.6x |

::: {.callout-warning}
## Loop-Based Variables Don't Scale
Loop-based variable construction creates O(n²) expression tree nodes, causing exponential compilation time. Use VectorVariable for n > 50.
:::

### VectorVariable (n ≤ 2,000)

| n | Build | Cold Solve | Warm Solve | SciPy | Cold Overhead | Warm Overhead |
|---|-------|------------|------------|-------|---------------|---------------|
| 10 | 0.1ms | 1.4ms | 1.2ms | 1.4ms | 1.1x | 0.9x |
| 25 | 0.1ms | 1.7ms | 1.3ms | 1.4ms | 1.3x | 1.0x |
| 50 | 0.2ms | 2.9ms | 2.2ms | 1.7ms | 1.8x | 1.4x |
| 100 | 0.3ms | 6.9ms | 3.4ms | 3.5ms | 2.1x | 1.1x |
| 500 | 1.5ms | 147ms | 54.4ms | 53.8ms | 2.8x | **1.0x** |
| 1000 | 3.6ms | 468ms | 224ms | 252ms | 1.9x | **0.9x** |
| 2000 | 6.7ms | 1,910ms | 941ms | 1,013ms | 1.9x | **0.9x** |

**VectorVariable achieves parity or better than raw SciPy** for warm solves at all scales. Cold solve overhead is ~2x due to one-time compilation.

## NLP Scaling: Unconstrained Optimization

![NLP Scaling Comparison](assets/benchmarks/nlp_scaling_comparison.png){width=100%}

Objective: `min Σx²ᵢ - Σxᵢ` (optimal at x* = 0.5)

### VectorVariable with `x @ x - x.sum()`

| n | Build | Cold Solve | Warm Solve | SciPy | Cold Overhead | Warm Overhead |
|---|-------|------------|------------|-------|---------------|---------------|
| 10 | 0.0ms | 1.3ms | 0.5ms | 0.3ms | 4.0x | 1.6x |
| 25 | 0.1ms | 2.4ms | 0.6ms | 0.4ms | 5.8x | 1.6x |
| 50 | 0.1ms | 5.2ms | 0.8ms | 0.7ms | 8.0x | 1.3x |
| 100 | 0.1ms | 49.9ms | 1.1ms | 0.9ms | 56.5x | 1.4x |
| 500 | 2.5ms | 175ms | 3.0ms | 14.2ms | 12.5x | **0.4x** |
| 1000 | 1.0ms | 438ms | 20.4ms | 107ms | 4.1x | **0.2x** |
| 2000 | 2.1ms | 1,554ms | 16.6ms | 1,687ms | **0.9x** | **0.01x** |

::: {.callout-tip}
## At Large Scale, Optyx Can Be Faster
At n=2000, Optyx warm solves are **100x faster** than SciPy due to cached gradient computation and efficient vectorized evaluation.

## Constrained QP Scaling

![CQP Scaling Comparison](assets/benchmarks/cqp_scaling_comparison.png){width=100%}

Objective: `min Σx²ᵢ` subject to `Σxᵢ ≥ 1, xᵢ ≥ 0`

### VectorVariable with `x @ x`, `x.sum()`

| n | Build | Cold Solve | Warm Solve | SciPy | Cold Overhead | Warm Overhead |
|---|-------|------------|------------|-------|---------------|---------------|
| 10 | 0.1ms | 1.0ms | 0.4ms | 0.4ms | 2.9x | 1.3x |
| 25 | 0.1ms | 1.3ms | 0.6ms | 0.5ms | 2.5x | 1.2x |
| 50 | 0.1ms | 2.9ms | 0.8ms | 1.0ms | 3.0x | **0.9x** |
| 100 | 0.1ms | 2.2ms | 1.1ms | 1.3ms | 1.8x | **0.9x** |
| 500 | 0.5ms | 26.4ms | 15.2ms | 19.9ms | 1.4x | **0.8x** |
| 1000 | 1.2ms | 106ms | 88.8ms | 69.0ms | 1.6x | 1.3x |
| 2000 | 2.1ms | 584ms | 501ms | 471ms | 1.2x | 1.1x |

With O(1) Jacobian computation, constrained problems now achieve near-parity with SciPy.

## Overhead Summary by Problem Type

![Overhead Breakdown](assets/benchmarks/overhead_breakdown.png){width=100%}

| Problem Type | Cold Overhead | Warm Overhead |
|--------------|---------------|---------------|
| LP (n=50) | 2.1x | 1.7x |
| LP (n=500) | 2.6x | 1.3x |
| NLP (n=50) | 17.0x | 1.9x |
| NLP (n=500) | 7.5x | **0.2x** |
| CQP (n=50) | 1.8x | 1.7x |
| CQP (n=500) | 2.4x | **0.8x** |

**Pattern**: Cold overhead is 1.5-2.5x due to one-time compilation. Warm overhead is at or below 1x for all problem types - Optyx is often faster than raw SciPy on repeated solves.

## When to Use Optyx

### Ideal Use Cases

✅ **Parameter sweeps**: Solve similar problems with different parameters  
✅ **Real-time optimization**: Repeated solves with cached structure  
✅ **Prototyping**: Clean Python API, no manual gradients  
✅ **Large LP**: VectorVariable achieves parity with SciPy  
✅ **Non-convex NLP**: Automatic differentiation with exact gradients

### Consider Alternatives For

⚠️ **One-shot problems**: Cold-solve includes compilation overhead  
⚠️ **Large dense matrix problems (n>1000)**: CVXPY's specialized solvers may scale better  
⚠️ **Loop-based variables at scale**: Use VectorVariable instead

## Comparison with CVXPY

For convex problems, Optyx can be compared against CVXPY. Install with `uv sync --extra benchmarks`.

| Problem | Optyx | CVXPY | Overhead | Notes |
|---------|-------|-------|----------|-------|
| Small LP (2 vars) | 1.1ms | 1.0ms | 1.08x | Near parity |
| Medium LP (20 vars) | 1.3ms | 1.5ms | **0.85x** | Optyx faster |
| Simple QP | 0.4ms | 1.2ms | **0.33x** | Optyx 3x faster |
| Portfolio QP (n=10) | 3.6ms | 2.5ms | 1.47x | CVXPY's specialized QP solver |
| Portfolio QP (n=50) | 17.6ms | 1.7ms | 10.1x | CVXPY scales better for large QP |

::: {.callout-note}
## Optyx vs CVXPY: Different Strengths
- **LP/Simple QP**: Optyx matches or beats CVXPY
- **Dense Quadratic Programs**: CVXPY's specialized `quad_form` with interior-point solvers scales better for large portfolio optimization
- **Non-convex NLP**: Optyx supports non-convex objectives with autodiff; CVXPY requires convexity
